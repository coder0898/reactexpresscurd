# reactexpresscurd
This is my first project which include backend side to create api.

In this project a fullstack user management system is created without any database.

The API used here is restfulAPI created using express and contains uuid for unique identification and cors for accessbility.

The project is divided into two parts

1.Server side 

2.Client side

1.Server side 

--> express,uuid and cors is used to create server.

--> customize RESTFULAPI is created using express which contains Adding, Editing, Deleting and Viewing of User details.

--> For continuation of server nodemon is used, allow smooth changes on server side.


2.Client side

--> create-react-app was used to create UI of system.

--> axios was used to call api and toastify for displaying messages.

--> To allow better styling Tailwindcss framework is used.

Note: In this project database was not used , will be added later.
